## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - Any `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say *"[Field Name] cannot be empty"*
  - The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say *"Looks like this is not an email"*

## My process
This was a very difficult project for me. I was having a hard time figuring out how to use form validation. So instead I just used the code from Bootstrap. I was unable to figure out how to use the icon-error image in the file. So instead I have it has hidden using CSS. But I came pretty close to the final design.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned a little bit about how to use form validation.

### Continued development

I need to practive more using form validation. I get the html component of it. But when it comes to using JavaScript, I am clueless as to which line of code does what. I am a bit familiar with .addEventListener but I still need to practice and read documentation to get a really good grasp on how to use JavaScript for form validation.

### Useful resources

- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.1/forms/validation/) - This helped me with using form validation using JavaScript.
- [YouTube](https://www.example.com) - This is a great tutorial for how to use JavaScript for form validation.
